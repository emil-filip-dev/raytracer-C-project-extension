# Raytracing with Animations in C - Group 44's Year 1 Summer Project extension

A photorealistic raytracer written in C with support for animations using a custom DSL.

Inspired by the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book, written by Peter Shirley.

## Demos

*Figure 1: The first successful test of the rendering capabilities of our raytracing engine. Metallic, glossy diffuse and glass materials are supported, each casting realistic shadows.*

*Figure 2: A render demonstrating the engine's physically accurate model of metallic surfaces, where the reflectance of metallic surfaces is not perfect and instead absorbs some of the light with each bounce (this can be seen as the reflections of the spheres get darker and darker as they "bounce" off one another).*

*Figure 3: Realistic camera depth of field was implemented quite easily.*

*Figure 4: A reconstruction of the final render from the Ray Tracing In One Weekend book, displaying our implementation of all of the features the book discussed. Despite the surreal scene, its visuals are quite photorealistic. Note the accurately rendered glass spheres and the subtle depth of field!*

![AnimationTest](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b127e829-7a8b-485e-a73f-b77eac046784)

*Figure 5: A test scene showing the result of changing the size of objects using the animation features of the raytracing program.*

<br>

![PanningTest](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4b272a3-0ab9-4c25-bda8-9c6f86366a89)

*Figure 6: Another test scene, showcasing the ability to animate the camera's transform (position and/or rotation).*

<br>

![FinalRender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66bcc72a-013b-4bcd-8db3-8dc50e69fa6f)

*Figure 7: The final submission render, featuring a "solar system"-like scene with "planets" of various materials, showcasing photorealism when rendering objects behind a glass object.*
